BugList:
- isEmpty does not work correctly when called on a single element list, follows suit that it does not work correctly on any sized list except any empty list.
- addBack is adding to the front instead of the back of the list.
-  removeBack and removeFront are not removing anything from the list, but does return false on a empty list.
